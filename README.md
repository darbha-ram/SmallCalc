# SmallCalc

SmallCalc is a simple arithmetic expression evaluator written in Java. It is based on [JavaCC](https://javacc.java.net).

## Prerequisities

* JDK 1.8+
* Gradle v2.14+

JavaCC is also a prerequisite, but it doesn't have to be explicitly installed as Gradle handles that dependency.

## Installing

To get a development environment running:
- Install a recent version of the Java SDK
- Install [Gradle2.14+](https://gradle.org)
- Ensure <gradleroot>/bin is in your PATH.
- Clone the repo from (Github)[https://github.com/darbha-ram/SmallCalc.git].


## Implementation 

This is a brief description of the implementation, it can be skipped if only interested in deploying and executing the application.

The application source is contained in src/main/javacc/SmallCalc.jj.  The "jj" file is a specification of the lexical and production rules of the grammar to be parsed by JavaCC.  With each production, Java code to be executed when segments of a rule are matched are provided.

For a description of "jj" file specification, see (JavaCC Documentation)[http://javacc.java.net/doc/docindex.html].

Grammar rules specified in SmallCalc.jj:
```
Expr := AddExpr | MultExpr | SubExpr | DivExpr | UnaryExpr | LetExpr
AddExpr := "add" "(" Expr "," Expr ")"
MultExpr := "mult" "(" Expr "," Expr ")"
SubExpr := "sub" "(" Expr "," Expr ")"
DivExpr := "div" "(" Expr "," Expr ")"
LetExpr := "let" "(" AlphaLiteral "," Expr "," Expr ")"
UnaryExpr := IntegerLiteral | AlphaLiteral
```


## Build and Deploy

```
$ cd SmallCalc (root folder of git repo)
$ gradle build
$ cd build/distributions
$ unzip SmallCalc.zip
$ cd SmallCalc/bin
```

## Execution Examples

SmallCalc uses log4j2 to log its progress. The file log4j2.xml in build/ configures log4j, e.g. the log file build/smallcalc.log.

To get usage info:

```
$ ./SmallCalc
```

To evaluate expression and filter logs at the level set in log4j2.xml:

```
$ ./SmallCalc "add(1, mult(3,4))"
```

To evaluate expression and filter logs at INFO level:

```
$ ./SmallCalc "add(1, mult(3,4))" INFO
```

## Running unit tests

JUnit tests are in src/test/java/SmallCalcTest.java.  They can be executed by:

```
$ gradle test
```

For each test, console output will indicate PASS, FAIL or SKIP.  A test report is also generated by gradle at build/reports/tests/index.html.
